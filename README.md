Billy Bot has been a passion project of mine for a little over 2 years now.

What began as a simple chat bot has flourished into a much larger and more complex project that I've been able to share with all my close friends

I do plan to revisit Billy at somepoint in the future, but due to work I am currently unable to find the free time.

That being said I hope you enjoy his code and find it useful in your own personal projects!

(I would usually put a requirements for this to work. But if I was to be completely honest it would take me about an hour to compile a simple list.)
